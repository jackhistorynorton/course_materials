LYSISTRATA
      What should the oath be, then?

CALONICE
      Let’s get a stallion, a white one, and then offer up its guts!

LYSISTRATA
      Why a white horse?

CALONICE
	``Then how will we make our oath?

LYSISTRATA
      I’ll tell you, by god, if you want to hear.
      Put a large dark bowl down on the ground,
      then sacrifice a jug of Thasian wine,
      and swear we’ll never pour in water.

LAMPITO
      Now, if you ask me, that’s a super oath!

LYSISTRATA
      Someone get the bowl and a jug of wine.

[The Scythian girl goes back in the house and returns with a bowl 
and a jug of wine. Calonice takes the bowl]

CALONICE
      Look, dear ladies, at this splendid bowl.                                                              220                [200]
       Just touching this gives instant pleasure.

LYSISTRATA
      Put it down. Now join me and place your hands
      on our sacrificial victim.

[The women gather around the bowl and lay their hands on the 
wine jug. Lysistrata starts the ritual prayer]

      O you,
      Goddess of Persuasion and the bowl
      which we so love, accept this sacrifice,
      a women’s offering, and be kind to us.

[Lysistrata opens the wine jug and lets the wine pour out into the bowl]

CALONICE
      Such healthy blood spurts out so beautifully!

LAMPITO
      By Castor, that’s a mighty pleasant smell.

MYRRHINE
      Ladies, let me be the first to swear the oath.

CALONICE
      No, by Aphrodite, no—not unless                                              230
      your lot is drawn.

LYSISTRATA [holds up a bowl full of wine]
                                  Grab the brim, Lampito,
      you and all the others. Someone repeat                                                                              [210]
      for all the rest of you the words I say—
      that way you’ll pledge your firm allegiance:
      No man, no husband and no lover . . . 

CALONICE [taking the oath]
     No man, no husband and no lover . . . 

LYSISTRATA
      . . . will get near me with a stiff prick. . . Come on,
      say it!

CALONICE
              . . . will get near me with a stiff prick.
      O Lysistrata, my knees are getting weak!

LYSISTRATA
      At home I’ll live completely without sex . . .                                                    240

CALONICE
      At home I’ll live completely without sex . . .

LYSISTRATA
      . . . wearing saffron silks, with lots of make up . . .

CALONICE
      . . . wearing saffron silks, with lots of make up . . .                                                  [220]

LYSISTRATA
      . . . to make my man as horny as I can.

CALONICE
      . . . to make my man as horny as I can.

LYSISTRATA
      If against my will he takes me by force . . . 

CALONICE
      If against my will he takes me by force . . . 

LYSISTRATA
      . . . I’ll be a lousy lay, not move a limb.

CALONICE
      . . . I’ll be a lousy lay, not move a limb.

LYSISTRATA
      I’ll not raise my slippers up towards the roof . . .                                        250

CALONICE
      I’ll not raise my slippers up towards the roof . . .                                                        [230] 

LYSISTRATA
      . . . nor crouch down like a lioness on all fours.

CALONICE
      . . . nor crouch down like a lioness on all fours. 

LYSISTRATA
      If I do all this, then I may drink this wine.

CALONICE
      If I do all this, then I may drink this wine.

LYSISTRATA
      If I fail, may this glass fill with water.

CALONICE
      If I fail, may this glass fill with water.

LYSISTRATA
      Do all you women swear this oath?

ALL
                                                              We do.

LYSISTRATA
      All right. I’ll make the offering.
